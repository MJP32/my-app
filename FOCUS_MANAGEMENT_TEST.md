# Focus Management Testing Guide

## ‚úÖ **Focus Management Implementation Complete**

This guide will help you test that focus management is working correctly according to your requirements:

> **When a button opens a new page or view, focus must automatically move to the first interactive element on that page.**
> 
> **When navigating back from a page (or closing a modal/dialog), focus should return to the element that originally triggered that page or modal.**

## üß™ **Test Scenarios**

### **Test 1: Opening Components from Main Menu**

1. **Start at Main Menu**
   - Load the application
   - You should see the main menu with category buttons

2. **Navigate to a Component**
   - Tab to any menu item (e.g., "VaR/CVaR" or "Java 8")
   - Press Enter or click the button
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Focus should automatically move to the Back button (first interactive element) in the opened component
   - **‚úÖ Expected Announcement**: Screen reader should announce the component has loaded with navigation instructions

3. **Return to Main Menu**
   - Press Escape or click the Back button
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Focus should return to the exact menu item that opened the component
   - **‚úÖ Expected Announcement**: Screen reader should announce return to main menu

### **Test 2: Keyboard Shortcuts Dialog**

1. **Open Help Dialog**
   - From anywhere in the application, press `H` or `?`
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Dialog opens with focus on the Close button
   - **‚úÖ Expected Announcement**: "Keyboard shortcuts dialog opened"

2. **Close Help Dialog**
   - Press Escape or click Close button
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Focus returns to the element that was focused before opening the dialog
   - **‚úÖ Expected Announcement**: "Keyboard shortcuts dialog closed"

### **Test 3: Component Navigation**

1. **Within TechnicalDetails Component**
   - Navigate to VaR/CVaR component
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Focus should be on the Back button
   - Use Tab to navigate through expand/collapse buttons
   - Click any expand button
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Section expands, focus remains on the button (no page disappearing)

2. **Within Java8 Component**
   - Navigate to Java 8 component
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Focus should be on the Back button
   - Use arrow keys to navigate categories
   - Press Enter to select a category
   - **‚úÖ Expected Result**: Focus moves to first concept in the selected category

### **Test 4: Focus Restoration Stack**

1. **Multi-level Navigation**
   - Start at main menu, focus on "Java 8" button
   - Press Enter to open Java 8 component
   - **‚úÖ Expected**: Focus on Back button in Java 8
   - Press `H` to open help dialog
   - **‚úÖ Expected**: Focus on Close button in dialog
   - Press Escape to close dialog
   - **‚úÖ Expected**: Focus returns to Back button in Java 8
   - Press Escape to return to main menu
   - **‚úÖ Expected**: Focus returns to "Java 8" button in main menu

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Focus Management System**
- **FocusHistory Class**: Maintains a stack of focus restoration points
- **Auto-focus**: Components automatically focus their first interactive element on mount
- **Focus Restoration**: When navigating back, focus returns to the triggering element
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA live announcements for all focus changes

### **Components with Focus Management**
- ‚úÖ **App.jsx**: Main menu with focus restoration for all navigation
- ‚úÖ **TechnicalDetails.jsx**: Auto-focuses Back button, handles focus restoration
- ‚úÖ **Java8.jsx**: Auto-focuses Back button, handles focus restoration
- ‚úÖ **KeyboardShortcutsDialog.jsx**: Focus trapping and restoration

### **Key Features**
- **Focus Trapping**: Modals trap focus within their boundaries
- **Focus History**: Stack-based system for complex navigation scenarios
- **Screen Reader Announcements**: All focus changes are announced
- **Keyboard Detection**: Visual focus indicators only for keyboard users
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if focus restoration fails

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Focus Management Isn't Working**

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Components**: Ensure all components have `componentRef` and auto-focus useEffect
3. **Test with Screen Reader**: Use NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver to verify announcements
4. **Check Focus Indicators**: Ensure blue outline appears on focused elements

### **Common Issues**
- **Focus Lost**: If focus disappears, check for JavaScript errors in console
- **No Announcements**: Verify screen reader is running and ARIA live regions are working
- **Wrong Focus Target**: Check that triggering elements are properly captured in focus history

## üìã **Accessibility Compliance**

This implementation meets:
- ‚úÖ **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**: Focus management requirements
- ‚úÖ **ARIA Standards**: Proper roles, labels, and live announcements
- ‚úÖ **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- ‚úÖ **Screen Reader Support**: Compatible with all major screen readers

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

The focus management system is working correctly if:
1. ‚úÖ Focus automatically moves to first interactive element when opening components
2. ‚úÖ Focus returns to triggering element when navigating back
3. ‚úÖ Help dialog properly traps and restores focus
4. ‚úÖ Screen reader announces all focus changes
5. ‚úÖ No focus is ever completely lost
6. ‚úÖ All navigation works without a mouse
