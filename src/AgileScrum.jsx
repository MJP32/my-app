  - Day 7-10: Testing & Refinement

Sprint Review (End of sprint):

    - Implementation unclear

    During Refinement:

    Product Owner: "Users often forget passwords and need a way

    Team Questions:
    - How is identity verified? (Email link)
    - How long is reset link valid? (1 hour)
    - Can old password be reused? (No, last 5 passwords)
    - What if email doesn't arrive? (Resend option)
    - What about expired accounts? (Show account status)

    Updated Story:
    As a user with forgotten password
    I want to reset my password via email
    So that I can regain access to my account without contacting support

    Acceptance Criteria:
    1. Given I click "Forgot Password"
       When I enter my email
       Then I receive password reset email within 5 minutes

    2. Given I click reset link in email
       When link is less than 1 hour old
       Then I see password reset form

    3. Given I enter new password
       When new password is different from last 5 passwords
       Then my password is updated

    4. Given reset link is expired
       When I click link
       Then I see "Link expired" message
       And option to request new link

    5. Given I enter invalid email
       When I submit forgot password
       Then I see "If account exists, email sent" (security)

    Estimated: 5 story points

    Dependencies: Email service must be configured

    Story is now READY for Sprint Planning

        explanation: 'Agile estimation uses relative sizing instead of hours to estimate work. Story Points represent the effort, complexity, and uncertainty of a user story relative to other stories. Teams use Planning Poker with Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) to estimate collaboratively, promoting discussion and consensus. Velocity is the average story points completed per sprint, used for forecasting and capacity planning. T-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL) provides rough estimates for epics. Estimation focuses on comparing stories rather than predicting exact time.',
        keyPoints: [
          'Story Points: Relative sizing representing effort, complexity, and risk',
          'Fibonacci Sequence: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 - larger numbers = more uncertainty',
          'Planning Poker: Team estimation technique using cards, promotes discussion',
          'Velocity: Average story points completed per sprint, used for forecasting',
          'T-shirt Sizing: XS, S, M, L, XL for initial rough estimates',
          'Reference Story: Baseline story (typically 3 points) to compare against',
          'Re-estimation: Dont re-estimate completed stories, use original estimate for velocity',

        codeExample: `// Agile Estimation Implementation

// 1. Story Points Fundamentals
public class StoryPoints {

  // Fibonacci Scale (most common)
  /*
  1 point  - Trivial, almost no effort
    Example: Change button text
    Effort: 1-2 hours
    Complexity: None
    Risk: None

  2 points - Very simple, minimal effort
    Example: Add new field to form
    Effort: 2-4 hours
    Complexity: Low
    Risk: Low

  3 points - Simple, straightforward
    Example: Create new API endpoint (CRUD)
    Effort: 4-8 hours (about 1 day)
    Complexity: Low-Medium
    Risk: Low

  5 points - Moderate complexity
    Example: User login with JWT authentication
    Effort: 1-2 days
    Complexity: Medium
    Risk: Medium

  8 points - Complex, significant effort
    Example: Product search with filters
    Effort: 2-4 days
    Complexity: High
    Risk: Medium-High

  13 points - Very complex, should split
    Example: Complete checkout flow
    Effort: 4+ days
    Complexity: Very High
    Risk: High

  21+ points - Epic, must split into smaller stories

    5 points: User login with authentication

  ✓ Estimate as a team (whole team)

  ✓ Track velocity for 3-6 sprints before forecasting
  ✓ Don't compare velocities between teams
  ✓ Use estimates for planning, not judging performance
  ✓ Split stories > 13 points
  ✓ Focus on conversation during estimation
  ✓ Capture learning from completed stories
  ✓ Don't pad estimates with buffers (already in points)

  ✗ Don't estimate in hours
  ✗ Don't let one person estimate alone
  ✗ Don't pressure team on velocity
  ✗ Don't re-estimate completed stories
  ✗ Don't treat story points as commitments
  ✗ Don't use velocity as productivity metric
  ✗ Don't estimate every task, only user stories
  ✗ Don't change estimates to fit in sprint

  ❌ Scrum-but
  "We do Scrum, but we skip retrospectives"

  ✅ Follow Scrum framework completely or adapt transparently

  ❌ Agile Theater
  Going through motions without embracing mindset
  ✅ Focus on principles, not just rituals

  ❌ Mini-Waterfall Sprints
  Requirements → Design → Development → Testing in sequence
  ✅ Cross-functional work throughout sprint

  ❌ Velocity as Performance Metric
  Comparing teams, pressuring to increase velocity
  ✅ Use velocity for planning only

  ❌ Changing Sprint Length
  2-week sprints, then 3-week, then 1-week
  ✅ Consistent sprint length

  ❌ Not Protecting Sprint
  Adding work mid-sprint, changing requirements
  ✅ Protect sprint commitment

  ❌ Skipping Ceremonies
  "Too busy to do retrospective"
  ✅ All ceremonies are essential

  ❌ Large Teams
  12-person "Agile team"
  ✅ Keep teams 5-9 people, split if larger

  ❌ No Definition of Done
  "Done" means different things
  ✅ Clear shared DoD

  ❌ Technical Stories
  "Refactor database" without user value
  ✅ Frame work in terms of user value
